# Fractyl
## a.k.a. Fractylizer
i'm fractyl and i use github occasionally for various things.
i used to make bad things now i make mediocre things.
but improvement isn't about comparing yourself to others, it's about comparing yourself to yourself but when you had less time to learn things.
## what's here?
not much. some unfinished dashnet mods, an igmgames fork, and remnants of my old website.
i have some private repos where i host some cool stuff that uses servers (like fractylchat).
